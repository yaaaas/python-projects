Task: For a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

Program flow
1. List is intialised
2. List is iterated over with only even values being re-assigned back to the list
3. New list with purely even values is printed out


Sample output

Case 1 : a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```
>>[4, 16, 36, 64, 100] //Even values are printed out
```
