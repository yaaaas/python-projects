Task: Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user

Program Flow:

1. User is asked to input any number that they wish to work with
2. This input is then assigned to the variable <i>num</i>
3. The User is then prompted for another number to divide the original number <i>num</i> by. This input will then be assigned to the variable <i>check</i>
4. The original number is then evaluated to see if it is an even number or not.
5. <i>Num</i> is then divided by <i>check</i> to see if it divides evenly. ( See sample input/output for sample output messages)

Sample Input/Output:


Case 1: Even Number that divides evenly when an appropriate check value is used.
```
>>Please input a number:  20 
>>Please enter a number to divide 20 by:  4

20 is a multiple of 4 and an even number!
20 is also divisible by 4
```

Case 2: Odd Number that does not divide evenly when an inappropriate check value is used.
```
>>Please input a number:  5
>>Please enter a number to divide 5 by:  4

5 is an odd number!
5 is not divisible by 4
```
