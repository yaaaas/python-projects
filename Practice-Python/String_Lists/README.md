Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)

Program Flow
1. User is prompted for a string
2. The string is then stripped of all whitespace and compared to it's reversed form
3. If it is a palindrome, the message "It is a palindrome" is printed. If it is not, the message "It is not a palindrome" is printed

Case 1: No Palindrome
```
please input the string to be compared:  Ben
The Original string is: Ben
this is not a palindrome!
```

Case 2: A palindrome is given
```
please input the string to be compared:  RAceCar
The Original string is: RAceCar
This is a palindrome! When reversed, it forms racecar
```
