Task : Take two lists and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes., say for example these two:

Program Flow

1. User is prompted to key in a length for array a and b
2. These two arrays are then randomly generated and compared using the list.intersection method
3. The resulting array is assigned to array c and printed

Sample output

```
>>>Please input length of array a:  3
>>>Please input length of array b:  4

Array A is: [1, 5, 5]
Array B is: [1, 5, 8, 7]
[1, 5]
```
