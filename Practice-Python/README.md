Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

Extras:

Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message. (Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. (Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)

Sample Input/Output:
```
Please Enter your age //User Inputs age in the same row//
You will be 100 in (100-user's age)! //Phrase printed is the number of years is above 50.


Eg 1.
Please enter your age 40
You will be 100 in 60 years. That will be in 2077 ! That's a long way more!

Eg2.
Please Enter your age 60
You will be 100 in 40 years. That will be in 2057 ! That's quite soon lel
```

Phrases printed are either "That's a long way more" or "That's quite soon lel".
