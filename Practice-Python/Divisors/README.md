Task : Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

Program Flow
1. User is prompted for a number to evaluate
2. The program then runs a loop to find all the possible divisors by taking a variable n and using it to divide the number. 
3. The final list of divisors is finally printed out


Sample Output/Input

Case 1 : 8-digit number with divisors. ( Run time is ~10s for an approximate 20000000 loops run )
```
Key in the number you want to emulate  20000000
The divisors of 20000000 are [1,2,4,5,8,10,16,20,25,32,40,50,64,80,100,125,128,160,200,250,256,320,400,500,625,640,800,1000,1250,1280,1600,2000,2500,3125,3200,4000,5000,6250,6400,8000,10000,12500,15625,16000,20000,25000,31250,32000,40000,50000,62500,78125,80000,100000,125000,156250,160000,200000,250000,312500,400000,500000,625000,800000,1000000,1250000,2000000,2500000,4000000,5000000,10000000,20000000]
